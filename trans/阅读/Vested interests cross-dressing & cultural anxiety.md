对于一战前的儿童, 蓝色代表女孩, 粉色代表男孩. 二战后却反过来了

对于纽约的男同性恋者来说, 他们通过红色领带互相识别
但是上世纪90年代后, 政客却开始使用红色领带
For most gay men, the green suits and flashy feathers were too daring and conspicuous; wearing a red tie was slightly more on the down low. It was a signal used by many in New York’s gay circles.  If you wore a red tie in one of New York’s cruising areas, you would catch the attention of gay men.  It was a bold choice in an era that favored more conservative colors, but easier to pull off than wearing a t-shirt that says, “I love cock!”
