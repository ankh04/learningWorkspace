- [x] prework for personal music player
	- the music downloaded from NetEase music player is locked as ncm file. So I need to  use this [project](https://github.com/unlock-music/unlock-music) to unlock this kind of foramtted file.
	- Then I should consider how to upload this mp3 file on the server. (COS?)
	- Then the basic music player should be designed
- [x] preword for daily log task
	- for daily task log, I consider to use [github actions](https://docs.github.com/cn/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions), which can monitor the change of my every commits, then I need to code something to count the info I need.
			- need to learn how to use github actions.
	- for health data, there are two ways:
			- export the data, read the xml (which is very large, like 100Mb)，extract info from this file. 
				- use this [project](https://github.com/jameno/Simple-Apple-Health-XML-to-CSV)  and [app](https://www.ericwolter.com/projects/apple-health-export/#faq-anchor) to convert xml to csv
				- here are some [articles](https://www.ryanpraski.com/apple-health-data-how-to-export-analyze-visualize-guide/) to help you read the data from exported file using python
				- 👍 the advantage of this way is that you can handle all the data as you like
				- 👎 the disadvantage of this way is that it is really inconvenience if I want to export the data every
			- use [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/guide/shortcuts/apdf22b0444c/ios) app (choosen plan)
				- it can extract the information you need by using original supported method
